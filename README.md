# JS Console

[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png)](https://flattr.com/thing/66434/JS-Console-for-iOS)

A JavaScript web console, useful for quick experimentation, debugging, presentations (for live coding) and workshops.

This is the native version of [JS Console](http://jsconsole.com) - please do donate via the pledgie above if you find yourself building and using this app.

**If you don't have a developer account, you can now get [JS Console through the iTunes store](http://jsconsole.com/app/) ($99 for a developer account vs. 99&cent; for the compiled app!)**

# Features

- Resizable font (yep, biggest issue with Firebug in workshops)
- Autocomplete in WebKit desktop browsers
- shift + up/down for bigger console
- Save history (based on session)
- Add support for loading in a DOM (YQL - I thank you again)
- Permalink to individual executions

# Note

This version of jsconsole uses copied files from [http://github.com/remy/jsconsole](http://github.com/remy/jsconsole) - but a subset, not *all* the files. Therefore the files are (for now) manually synced.

# TODO

- Permalink to session (trickier, server side required - can I do it without?)
